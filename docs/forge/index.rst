Forge System
=====================

The Forge system provides automated catalog generation through GitHub Issues and GitLab CI/CD integration.

Overview
--------

The Forge system allows users to request catalog generation through GitHub Issues without needing
to install or run tools locally. The system automatically:

* Validates user inputs
* Generates Intake v2 or STAC catalogs
* Creates downloadable artifacts
* Posts results back to the GitHub issue

Getting Started
---------------

Start with the :doc:`FORGE_QUICKSTART` guide for a quick introduction, or read the complete
:doc:`FORGE` documentation for detailed information.
